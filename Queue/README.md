Airport Check-in simulation

  1. Simulation check in at an airport counter with 2 queues and 2 first class counters for the first class queue 
  and 3 coach class counters for the one coach queue.
  2. This was an assignment for my graduate data structures and algorithm course.  
  3. Its probably more bloated than it should be.  Plan to revisit and optimize.
  4. Design specifications are commented in the program.
