// The following code calls a naive algorithm for computing a Fibonacci number.
//
// What to do:
// 1. Compile the following code and run it on an input "40" to check that it is slow.
//    You may also want to submit it to the grader to ensure that it gets the "time limit exceeded" message.
// 2. Implement the fibonacci_fast procedure.
// 3. Remove the line that prints the result of the naive algorithm, comment the lines reading the input,
//    uncomment the line with a call to test_solution, compile the program, and run it.
//    This will ensure that your efficient algorithm returns the same as the naive one for small values of n.
// 4. If test_solution() reveals a bug in your implementation, debug it, fix it, and repeat step 3.
// 5. Remove the call to test_solution, uncomment the line with a call to fibonacci_fast (and the lines reading the input),
//    and submit it to the grader.

// Provide by course

    if (n <= 1)

}

// This was written by me
