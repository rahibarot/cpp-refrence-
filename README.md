# CPP-Codes-and-Solutions

Solutions to common challenges found on the Internet.

Also, solutions to problems presented during my courses at NJIT and BCC.

My solutions to challenges found in Cracking the Coding Interview.

Where the solution is procedural, main.cpp will be complete.

Where the solution is OOP oriented with class functions, the solution will have header file, implementation (source) file, and client (main) file.

Whenever possible, coding will be modularized with function calls from int main().
