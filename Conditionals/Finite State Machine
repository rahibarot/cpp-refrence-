/*
 This program that models a finite state automaton assigns conditions 0 to 4 that models state zero to state 4.  
 It only considers 0 and 1 as input.  It only moves from state to state based on the input of 1101. Any other combinatin, 
 be it 1 and 0 or any other input will not move the state from zero to four.  
 I had considered using enum values to assign "words to integers" but decided to stay with integers for simplicity sake.
