//URLify, replace space with "%20"
    //Stumbled upon this simple code at Stack Overflow.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2687428/replacing-space-with-20?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa
    To replace a character with a character is a straightforward loop operation at O(n) but 
    replacing one character with more than one character is a bit more complicated.  I had 
    some issues but this code is fairly straightforward I think. It uses the find and replace 
    functions for strings.
    
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;


void findSpace(string s){
    for(size_t pos = s.find(' '); pos != string::npos; pos = s.find(' ', pos)){
        s.replace(pos, 1, "%20");
    }
    cout << s << endl;
}

int main(){
    
    string s;
    cout << "enter string: ";
    getline(cin, s);
    findSpace(s);
    
    return 0;
}
