/*
Mark and Jane are very happy after having their first kid. Their son loves toys, so Mark wants to buy some. 
There are a number of different toys lying in front of him, tagged with their prices. 
Mark has only a certain amount to spend, and he wants to maximize the number of toys he buys with this money.
Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of toys Mark can buy?
